Generating content with AI models
At the heart of generative AI are AI models. Currently, the two most prominent examples of
generative models are large language models (LLMs) and image generation models. These
models take input, called a prompt (most commonly text, an image, or a combination of both),
and from it produce as output text, an image, or even audio or video.
The output of these models can be surprisingly convincing: LLMs generate text that appears as
though it could have been written by a human being, and image generation models can produce
images that are very close to real photographs or artwork created by humans.
In addition, LLMs have proven capable of tasks beyond simple text generation:
Writing computer programs
Planning subtasks that are required to complete a larger task
Organizing unorganized data
Understanding and extracting information data from a corpus of text
Following and performing automated activities based on a text description of the activity
There are many models available to you, from several different providers. Each model has its own
strengths and weaknesses and one model might excel at one task but perform less well at
others. Apps making use of generative AI can often benefit from using multiple different mode
depending on the task at hand.
As an app developer, you typically don't interact with generative AI models directly, but rather
through services available as web APIs. Although these services often have similar functionality,
they all provide them through different and incompatible APIs. If you want to make use of
multiple model services, you have to use each of their proprietary SDKs, potentially incompatible
with each other. And if you want to upgrade from one model to the newest and most capable one,
you might have to build that integration all over again.
Genkit addresses this challenge by providing a single interface that abstracts away the details of
accessing potentially any generative AI model service, with several pre-built implementations
already available. Building your AI-powered app around Genkit simplifies the process of maki
your first generative AI call and makes it equally easy to combine multiple models or swap o
model for another as new models emerge.

Loading and configuring model plugi
Before you can use Genkit to start generating content, you need to load and configure a mod
plugin. If you're coming from the Getting Started guide, you've already done this. Otherwise, see
the Getting Started (https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/get-started?authuser=0) guide or t
individual plugin's documentation and follow the steps there before continuing.
The generate() method
In Genkit, the primary interface through which you interact with generative AI models is the
generate() method.
The simplest generate() call specifies the model you want to use and a text promp
When you run this brief example, it will print out some debugging information followed by the
output of the generate() call, which will usually be Markdown text as in the following example:
import { gemini15Flash, googleAI } from '@genkit-ai/googleai';
import { genkit } from 'genkit';
const ai = genkit({
plugins: [googleAI()],
model: gemini15Flash,
});
(async () => {
const { text } = await ai.generate(
'Invent a menu item for a pirate themed restaurant.'
);
console.log(text);
})();

You can also specify a model for a single generate() call:
This example uses a model reference exported by the model plugin. Another option is to specify
the model using a string identifie
A model string identifier looks like providerid/modelid, where the provider ID (in this cas
googleai) identifies the plugin, and the model ID is a plugin-specific string identifier for a 
version of a model.
Some model plugins, such as the Ollama plugin, provide access to potentially dozens of different
models and therefore do not export individual model references. In these cases, you can only
specify a model to generate() using its string identifie
These examples also illustrate an important point: when you use generate() to make generative
AI model calls, changing the model you want to use is simply a matter of passing a different
value to the model parameter. By using generate() instead of the native model SDKs, you give
yourself the flexibility to more easily use several different models in your app and change mode
in the future.

**Description:** This dish is a tribute to the hearty meals enjoyed by pirates
on the high seas. The beef is tender and flavorful, infused with the warm spices
of rum and molasses. The pineapple salsa adds a touch of sweetness and acidity,
balancing the richness of the stew. The cannonball serving vessel adds a fun and
thematic touch, making this dish a perfect choice for any pirate-themed
adventure.
const { text } = await ai.generate({
model: gemini15Pro,
prompt: 'Invent a menu item for a pirate themed restaurant.',
});
const { text } = await ai.generate({
model: 'googleai/gemini-1.5-pro-latest',
prompt: 'Invent a menu item for a pirate themed restaurant.',
});
So far you have only seen examples of the simplest generate() calls. However, generate() also
provides an interface for more advanced interactions with generative models, which you will see
in the sections that follow.
System prompts
Some models support providing a system prompt, which gives the model instructions as to how
you want it to respond to messages from the user. You can use the system prompt to specify a
persona you want the model to adopt, the tone of its responses, the format of its responses, and
so on.
If the model you're using supports system prompts, you can provide one with the system
parameter:
Model parameters
The generate() function takes a config parameter, through which you can specify optional
settings that control how the model generates content:
The exact parameters that are supported depend on the individual model and model API.
However, the parameters in the previous example are common to almost every model. The
following is an explanation of these parameters:
Parameters that control output length
const { text } = await ai.generate({
system: 'You are a food industry marketing consultant.',
prompt: 'Invent a menu item for a pirate themed restaurant.',
});
const { text } = await ai.generate({
prompt: 'Invent a menu item for a pirate themed restaurant.',
config: {
maxOutputTokens: 400,
stopSequences: ['<end>', '<fin>'],
temperature: 1.2,
topP: 0.4,
topK: 50,
},
});
maxOutputTokens
LLMs operate on units called tokens. A token usually, but does not necessarily, map to a specif
sequence of characters. When you pass a prompt to a model, one of the first steps it takes is 
tokenize your prompt string into a sequence of tokens. Then, the LLM generates a sequence of
tokens from the tokenized input. Finally, the sequence of tokens gets converted back into text,
which is your output.
The maximum output tokens parameter simply sets a limit on how many tokens to generate
using the LLM. Every model potentially uses a different tokenizer, but a good rule of thumb is to
consider a single English word to be made of 2 to 4 tokens.
As stated earlier, some tokens might not map to character sequences. One such example is that
there is often a token that indicates the end of the sequence: when an LLM generates this token,
it stops generating more. Therefore, it's possible and often the case that an LLM generates fewer
tokens than the maximum because it generated the "stop" token.
stopSequences
You can use this parameter to set the tokens or token sequences that, when generated, indicate
the end of LLM output. The correct values to use here generally depend on how the model was
trained, and are usually set by the model plugin. However, if you have prompted the model to
generate another stop sequence, you might specify it here.
Note that you are specifying character sequences, and not tokens per se. In most cases, you will
specify a character sequence that the model's tokenizer maps to a single token.
Parameters that control "creativity"
The temperature, top-p, and top-k parameters together control how "creative" you want the model
to be. Below are very brief explanations of what these parameters mean, but the more important
point to take away is this: these parameters are used to adjust the character of an LLM's output.
The optimal values for them depend on your goals and preferences, and are likely to be found
only through experimentation.
temperature
LLMs are fundamentally token-predicting machines. For a given sequence of tokens (such as the
prompt) an LLM predicts, for each token in its vocabulary, the likelihood that the token comes
next in the sequence. The temperature is a scaling factor by which these predictions are divided
before being normalized to a probability between 0 and 1.
Low temperature values—between 0.0 and 1.0—amplify the difference in likelihoods between
tokens, with the result that the model will be even less likely to produce a token it already
evaluated to be unlikely. This is often perceived as output that is less creative. Although 0.0 is
technically not a valid value, many models treat it as indicating that the model should behave
deterministically, and to only consider the single most likely token.
High temperature values—those greater than 1.0—compress the differences in likelihoods
between tokens, with the result that the model becomes more likely to produce tokens it had
previously evaluated to be unlikely. This is often perceived as output that is more creative. Some
model APIs impose a maximum temperature, often 2.0.
topP
Top-p is a value between 0.0 and 1.0 that controls the number of possible tokens you want the
model to consider, by specifying the cumulative probability of the tokens. For example, a value of
1.0 means to consider every possible token (but still take into account the probability of each
token). A value of 0.4 means to only consider the most likely tokens, whose probabilities add up
to 0.4, and to exclude the remaining tokens from consideration.
topK
Top-k is an integer value that also controls the number of possible tokens you want the model to
consider, but this time by explicitly specifying the maximum number of tokens. Specifying a value
of 1 means that the model should behave deterministically.
Experiment with model parameters
You can experiment with the effect of these parameters on the output generated by different
model and prompt combinations by using the Developer UI. Start the developer UI with the
genkit start command and it will automatically load all of the models defined by the plugi
configured in your project. You can quickly try different prompts and configuration values wit
having to repeatedly make these changes in code.
Structured output
When using generative AI as a component in your application, you often want output in a format
other than plain text. Even if you're just generating content to display to the user, you can benef
from structured output simply for the purpose of presenting it more attractively to the user. But
for more advanced applications of generative AI, such as programmatic use of the model's
output, or feeding the output of one model into another, structured output is a must.
In Genkit, you can request structured output from a model by specifying a schema when you call
generate():
import { z } from 'genkit'; // Import Zod, which is re-exported by Genkit.
Model output schemas are specified using the Zod  (https://zod.dev/) library. In addition to
schema definition language, Zod also provides runtime type checking, which bridges the g
between static TypeScript types and the unpredictable output of generative AI models. Zod lets
you write code that can rely on the fact that a successful generate call will always return output
that conforms to your TypeScript types.
When you specify a schema in generate(), Genkit does several things behind the scenes:
Augments the prompt with additional guidance about the desired output format. This also
has the side effect of specifying to the model what content exactly you want to generate
(for example, not only suggest a menu item but also generate a description, a list of
allergens, and so on).
Parses the model output into a JavaScript object.
Verifies that the output conforms with the schem
To get structured output from a successful generate call, use the response object's output
property:
Handling errors
Note in the prior example that the output property can be null. This can happen when the model
fails to generate output that conforms to the schema. The best strategy for dealing with such
errors will depend on your exact use case, but here are some general hints:
const MenuItemSchema = z.object({
name: z.string(),
description: z.string(),
calories: z.number(),
allergens: z.array(z.string()),
});
const { output } = await ai.generate({
prompt: 'Invent a menu item for a pirate themed restaurant.',
output: { schema: MenuItemSchema },
});
if (output) {
const { name, description, calories, allergens } = output;
}
Try a different model. For structured output to succeed, the model must be capable of
generating output in JSON. The most powerful LLMs, like Gemini and Claude, are versatile
enough to do this; however, smaller models, such as some of the local models you would
use with Ollama, might not be able to generate structured output reliably unless they have
been specifically trained to do s
Make use of Zod's coercion abilities: You can specify in your schemas that Zod should try
to coerce non-conforming types into the type specified by the schema. If your sche
includes primitive types other than strings, using Zod coercion can reduce the number of
generate() failures you experience. The following version of MenuItemSchema uses type
coercion to automatically correct situations where the model generates calorie information
as a string instead of a number:
Retry the generate() call. If the model you've chosen only rarely fails to generate
conformant output, you can treat the error as you would treat a network error, and simply
retry the request using some kind of incremental back-off strategy.
Streaming
When generating large amounts of text, you can improve the experience for your users by
presenting the output as it's generated—streaming the output. A familiar example of streaming in
action can be seen in most LLM chat apps: users can read the model's response to their
message as it's being generated, which improves the perceived responsiveness of the application
and enhances the illusion of chatting with an intelligent counterpart.
In Genkit, you can stream output using the generateStream() method. Its syntax is similar to the
generate() method:
The response object has a stream property, which you can use to iterate over the streaming
output of the request as it's generated:
const MenuItemSchema = z.object({
name: z.string(),
description: z.string(),
calories: z.coerce.number(),
allergens: z.array(z.string()),
});
const { response, stream } = await ai.generateStream(
'Suggest a complete menu for a pirate themed restaurant.'
);
You can also get the complete output of the request, as you can with a non-streaming request:
Streaming also works with structured output:
Streaming structured output works a little differently from streaming text: the output property of
a response chunk is an object constructed from the accumulation of the chunks that have been
produced so far, rather than an object representing a single chunk (which might not be valid on its
own). Every chunk of structured output in a sense supersedes the chunk that came before it.
For example, here's what the first five outputs from the prior example might look l
for await (const chunk of stream) {
console.log(chunk.text);
}
const completeText = (await response).text;
const MenuSchema = z.object({
starters: z.array(MenuItemSchema),
mains: z.array(MenuItemSchema),
desserts: z.array(MenuItemSchema),
});
const { response, stream } = await ai.generateStream({
prompt: 'Suggest a complete menu for a pirate themed restaurant.',
output: { schema: MenuSchema },
});
for await (const chunk of stream) {
// `output` is an object representing the entire output so far.
console.log(chunk.output);
}
// Get the completed output.
const { output } = await response;
null
{ starters: [ {} ] }
{
Multimodal input
The examples you've seen so far have used text strings as model prompts. While this remains the
most common way to prompt generative AI models, many models can also accept other media
as prompts. Media prompts are most often used in conjunction with text prompts that instruct
the model to perform some operation on the media, such as to caption an image or transcribe an
audio recording.
The ability to accept media input and the types of media you can use are completely dependent
on the model and its API. For example, the Gemini 1.5 series of models can accept images, video,
and audio as prompts.
To provide a media prompt to a model that supports it, instead of passing a simple text prompt to
generate, pass an array consisting of a media part and a text part:
starters: [ { name: "Captain's Treasure Chest", description: 'A' } ]
}
{
starters: [
{
name: "Captain's Treasure Chest",
description: 'A mix of spiced nuts, olives, and marinated cheese served in a
calories: 350
}
]
}
{
starters: [
{
name: "Captain's Treasure Chest",
description: 'A mix of spiced nuts, olives, and marinated cheese served in a
calories: 350,
allergens: [Array]
},
{ name: 'Shipwreck Salad', description: 'Fresh' }
]
}
const { text } = await ai.generate([
{ media: { url: 'https://example.com/photo.jpg' } },
{ text: 'Compose a poem about this image.' },
]);
In the above example, you specified an image using a publicly-accessible HTTPS URL. You c
also pass media data directly by encoding it as a data URL. For example:
All models that support media input support both data URLs and HTTPS URLs. Some model
plugins add support for other media sources. For example, the Vertex AI plugin also lets you use
Cloud Storage (gs://) URLs.
Generating media
So far, most of the examples on this page have dealt with generating text using LLMs. However,
Genkit can also be used with image generation models. Using generate() with an image
generation model is similar to using an LLM. For example, to generate an image using the
Imagen2 model through Vertex AI:
1. Genkit uses data: URLs as the standard output format for generated media. This is a
standard format with many libraries available to handle them. This example uses the dataurls package from jsdom:
2. To generate an image and save it to a file, call generate(), specifying an image generati
model and the media type of output format:
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
const b64Data = await readFile('photo.jpg', { encoding: 'base64url' });
const dataUrl = `data:image/jpeg;base64,${b64Data}`;
const { text } = await ai.generate([
{ media: { url: dataUrl } },
{ text: 'Compose a poem about this image.' },
]);
$ npm i --save data-urls
$ npm i --save-dev @types/data-urls
import { imagen3Fast, vertexAI } from '@genkit-ai/vertexai';
import parseDataURL from 'data-urls';
import { genkit } from 'genkit';
import { writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';

Advanced LLM use
One way to enhance the capabilities of LLMs is to prompt them with a list of ways they can
request more information from you, or request you to perform some action. This is known
as tool calling or function calling. Models that are trained to support this capability can
respond to a prompt with a specially-formatted response, which indicates to the calling
application that it should perform some action and send the result back to the LLM along
with the original prompt. Genkit has library functions that automate both the prompt
generation and the call-response loop elements of a tool calling implementation. See Tool

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a technique used to introduce domain-specif
information into a model's output. This is accomplished by inserting relevant information
into a prompt before passing it on to the language model. A complete RAG implementation
requires you to bring several technologies together: text embedding generation models,
vector databases, and large language models. See Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
 (https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit/rag?authuser=0) to learn how Genkit simplifies
process of coordinating these various elements.
Testing model output
As a software engineer, you're used to deterministic systems where the same input always
produces the same output. However, with AI models being probabilistic, the output can vary
based on subtle nuances in the input, the model's training data, and even randomness
deliberately introduced by parameters like temperature.
Genkit's evaluators are structured ways to assess the quality of your LLM's responses, using a
variety of strategies. Read more on the Evaluation
